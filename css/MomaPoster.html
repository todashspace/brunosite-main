          For this project, we were to make a poster for a hypothetical photography exhibit at the MoMA in New York. We were restricted to the use of one color (besides black and white) and no pictures or illustrations.

        </p>

        <p class="body-text">
          I wanted to make a poster that would represent both the fact that this was a photography exhibit at the MoMA, as well as the actual content of the exhibit itself. With this in mind, it needed to be something that would be considered "modern", as well as having that "artsy" vibe the MoMA is so well known for.

        </p>

        <p class="body-text">
          To achieve this, I chose to make ASCII art of one of the pictures from the collection, "Don Quixote" by Alberto Korda. It shows a man sitting on a lightpost in the middle of a protest in mexico city. I then put all the information for the exhibit inside the ASCII text, making it part of the image itself.

        </p>

        <p class="body-text">
          I wanted this to represent what, to me, makes up a phootgraph: bits of information adding up to a sum, and most importantly, the life inside. The silhouette, seen from afar, is easily discernable as a person; but the smaller details invite you in to look closer, and see everything that makes up the "picture", i.e. the life itself.
