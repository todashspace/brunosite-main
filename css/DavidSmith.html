         This was a book project on "The Fields of David Smith", a book about the famous sculptor written by his daugther, Candida N. Smith. It focuses on david smith's life both professionaly and at home, as well as his daughter's own unique outlooks on his life as seen through her eyes growing up.

         The requirements were open ended, besides a minimum page count of 12, and the inclusion of a "works" section.

        <p class="body-text">
        My initial mock-ups focused on the ideas of serenity and childhood, trying to instill a sense of peace. I was trying to achieve that feeling with a tight, white space focused layout, but I found that it needed more room for the emotional parts of the text to really breathe.

         So I took a look back- for me, the text was more than anything, a daughter reminiscing about her father and her childhood, two things long gone. I wanted to respect the fondess and serenity she spoke about her father with, as well as the heavy emphasis throguhout the writing on her early memories of the nature in the area in which she grew up.

      <p class="body-text">
         To do this, I chose to focus entirely on the landscape, and use it to both frame the text and set the tone,while also creating a cohesive visual language. The landscapes start at dawn and end at night, following along with the flow of David's life from beginning to end. Furthermore, I used childish illustrations of both what the text would be talking about, or of David's own works when applicable to highlight the innocence of the memories she's detailing.
      </p>
      
      <p class="body-text">
         The final page is an amalgamation of a wide selection of David's works, which I felt was suitable way to represent a lifetimes worth of experiences adding up.
