         This project was a physical book that would represent a Chicago neighborhood of my choosing, focusing on the typography found in the neighborhood itself. I would then have to include text provided by the teacher, talking about all the neighborhoods in the city. I chose to focus on Chinatown, both because I love going over there, and because of the unique, cramped style of signage typical of the area.
      </p>

      <p class="body-text">
        I used pictures I took myself to make up the layout of the book, using them to give structure to the rest of the text. This was meant to emulate the feel of all the stacked signs in chinatown, where you'll regularly find several businesses right next to each other, creating a cramped slightly overwhelming feeling. I used this to my advantage both to pay tribute to them, as well as to give it a unique visual identity. Finally, I made some illustrations of the sillier, cartoonish logos and symbols of the area both to include that side of the culture as well as to give the whole book a more playful feel.
